# Usage

Gatecheck is designed as a lightweight CLI utility first with configuration flexibility to work in any environment.

Developers can use it on the command line to summarize lengthy reports for a quick view or run an audit locally before
pushing code to be handed off to CI/CD.

It simplifies cross-referencing with [FIRST's Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)](https://www.first.org/epss/) 
API to match CVEs to vulnerability scores that provide more context than just 'critical, high, medium, etc.'.

Gatecheck also has some additional features to make bundling reports for attestation and archiving easy.
